# Student Performance Manager

The Student Performance Manager is a web-based application designed to help teachers manage student academic records in a simple and organized way. The system allows teachers to record and view student details, attendance, and performance, while students can log in to view their own academic information.

The main aim of the project is to reduce manual record keeping and provide a centralized platform for managing student performance data.

## Features
- Secure login for teachers and students
- Role-based access (teacher and student views)
- Student performance tracking
- Attendance management
- Simple dashboards for viewing information

## Technologies Used
- HTML and CSS for the user interface
- JavaScript for client-side logic
- Firebase Authentication for user login
- Firebase Firestore for database storage
- GitHub for version control

## Development Approach
The project follows an **incremental development approach**, where features are developed and tested one module at a time. This makes the system easier to build, understand, and extend in future phases.

## Current Status
- Phase 0: Project setup and Firebase configuration – Completed
- Phase 1: Authentication with role-based access – Completed
- Phase 2 onwards: Student management, attendance, and results – In progress

## Future Enhancements
- Detailed performance analytics
- Attendance alerts
- Report generation
- Improved user interface
